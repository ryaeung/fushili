# Fushili Language

Welcome to the Fushili Language repository! This is a custom-built language for Daton City using the hangeul script, which is a city we are recreating in Minecraft Bedrock (Realms, ported to Java as world file) under the project title "Project Mansion". The purpose of this repository is to host the translator of the language, which is an embed HTML file. Tutorials for the language itself will be released soon.

## Disclaimer
I'm just a coding noob messing around with HTML (just learnt this in two days so I can have something for 2nd Anniversary of Daton City).

## Usage for the Translator
To use the Fushili Language Translator, simply open the [link](ryaeung.github.io/fushili/) in your web browser. Once the page is loaded, you can input any English text into the left box. The translated text in Fushili language will then appear in the right box. Please note that since this is still in development, the translation may not be accurate at all times.

Fushili language is a one-to-one mapping with English with some unique vocabulary and syntax. However, reverse translation is not supported as one word in Fushili may have multiple English meanings. For example, the word `"넷초" (nesco)` can mean he, she, or it depending on the context.

## Other Usage
If you want to make any changes, or use my code for your own translator website, feel free to use my HTML code(I'd love to see what you're using this for). Glad that it helped your project if you used it!
